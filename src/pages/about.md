title: About Me
---

Professionally, I write .scala files for a living, but my real passion lies in the intricate world of metaprogramming,
compilers, and type systems. I'm currently deep in my BSc thesis, which lets me explore these topics even further. I
also keep tabs on what's happening in the Kotlin ecosystem. Outside of programming, I'm a musical theater enthusiast and
specialty coffee enjoyer.
